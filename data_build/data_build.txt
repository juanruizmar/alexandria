This library aims to offer some efficient solutions in C++ to frequent problems via data structures and
generic algorithms not present in the Standard Templates Library.

To know:
    - rand_generator instances are not thread-safe
    - matrix class is made with std::valarray, and cpp reference does not says to specialize that for use with bool.
    However, as it is expected to improve its behaviour to operate element-by-element, it was done so, instead of with std::vector.
    At this moment, its main purpose is to perform logical opperations with its <bool> version

This library contains some data structures and algorithms for solving NP-Complete problems

TO DO:
    - Include "adj_list" as part of graph constructor.
    - CNF_formula does not check about variables not in use.
    - CNF_formula does not use the most efficient algorithm. See "Algorithms for difficult problems" (Hromkovicz). There is a solution with 3CNF in O(1.84^n)
    - Create a more generic representation format. DIMACS is too poor. It could be based on .json or .xml.
